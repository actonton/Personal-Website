          <p align = "justify">Since I was a kid, I loved playing sports. I have represented my school in soccer, athletics, and chess. Out of these three sports, soccer is my favourite.
            Ronaldo is my favourite player and he plays for Juventus.  My favourite soccer team is Manchester United.  They are the best team in the world!</p>

          <!-- ***************  Soccer  **************** -->

          <p align = "justify">When I was in years 7, 8, and 9, I played in the regional league.  I played clubs from different regions of NSW.  I got to travel a lot to different suburbs and areas that I haven’t been to in NSW.  The best place (and the longest) I have travelled was to Griffith.
            We travelled for about 7-8 hours out off Sydney.  It was winter at the time, and when we got to our destination, it was snowing.  It was my first time playing soccer in the snow and it was fun.  </p>

          <!-- ***************  Athletics  **************** -->

          <p align = "justify">Starting from year 6, I got really into athletics.  I’ve also been representing my school in athletics.  The events that I normally do are 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay sprints.   When I was in year 7, I was lucky enough to represent our state in the 4x100m sprint.  It was one of the nerve-wracking moments in my life.
            We managed to finish first in the race, and we were awarded a gold medal.  We were ecstatic as we were celebrating our well-deserved win.</p>

          <p align = "justify">Lastly, I’ve been playing chess since primary school.  I’ve been playing inter-school competitions and I’ve also been representing my school in numerous chess competitions.  I’ve won lots awards and medals throughout my time playing chess.</p>
