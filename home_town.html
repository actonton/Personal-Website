          <ol>
            <li align = "justify"><a href = "https://au.hotels.com/go/philippines/manila-intramuros" target="_blank">Intramuros</a> is home to the oldest churches and administrative buildings in beautiful colonial architecture.  Philippines was a Spanish colony for more than 400 years!
              Famous churches are San Agustin Church and Manila Cathedral.  Fort Santiago is the military base for the Spanish government and is located close to the cathedral.
              While in Intramuros, also visit Casa Manila, a house built in 1980s as a reproduction of mid 19th century houses.</li>
            <br><li align = "justify"><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK3IHeI8C_4" target="_blank">Chinatown</a> – buildings are run-down but you can find here the best dim sum!</li>
            <br><li align = "justify">Shopping malls – Manila is surprisingly home to some of the world’s largest shopping malls. Visit SM North Edsa, <a href = "https://www.smsupermalls.com/mall-directory/sm-megamall/information/" target="_blank">SM Megamall</a>, SM Mall of Asia (yes, these have the same owners), <a href = "https://www.makaticity.com/shopping/greenbelt-mall.php" target="_blank">Greenbelt</a>, and <a href = "http://mallstoresdirectory.com/glorietta-makati" target="_blank">Glorietta</a>, plus a whole lot more.</li>

          <p>I never had much memories of the Philippines as I have left at an early age, but when it comes to food, I remember a lot because my mom still cooks them.
            Almost all dishes are eaten with rice- and my favourites are the marinated meat called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocino" target="_blank" >tocino</a> (sweetened and cured pork belly) , <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longaniza" target="_blank">longanisa</a> (is a Filipino local sausage or chorizo) and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapa_(Filipino_cuisine)" target="_blank">tapa</a> (thin slices of beef that are marinated and pan-fried).
            These are usually served for breakfast with fried egg (but are readily available anytime of the day because of its popularity among locals and foreigners too).  Pork barbeque is also popular (marinated pork slices that are skewered and grilled, similar to kebab).
            When it comes to dessert, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_caramel" target = "_blank">leche flan</a> is popular and it is similar to crème brulee.</p>
