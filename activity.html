          <p>Football is a team sport in which two teams consisting of 11 players, whose primary objective is to score goals past the opposition’s goalkeeper while preventing them from scoring in your team’s net.
            There are plenty of rules in football to follow.  The basic rules of football are:</p>
          <ol>

            <p>Soccer is a great sport to build health, whether it is mentally or energetically. When you play
               soccer, you work your entire cardiovascular system. This means your heart and lungs will greatly
               benefit you. Soccer is also capable of extending your life because soccer keeps you fit and slim and as a result, you are less likely

              <h2 id = "heading">Why Soccer?</h2>
              <p>I’ve been playing soccer since year 2 and I loved it since.  Playing it, being with a team, running with the ball, passing, dribbling across the field, skilling past the opposition, and scoring is pure fun.
                I always have to be on my toes, running, ready for the pass. I have to be aware of everything around me and making sure that my teammate with the ball has options.  It is also good exercise, both for my body and my brain. I have to be able to see everything and be one step ahead of my opposition.
                Lastly, winning games, especially against your club’s rival club just adds that cherry on top.</p>
